# A multi-image carousel in React

## Description

![Image-slider Screenshot](demo-image.png)

This is a multi-image carousel made in React. This carousel has a fixed width container that has many child elements arranged horizontally with an equal gap between them. The child elements that overflow the parent container's width is hidden and can be scrolled to make them into view with the help of left or right scroll arrows.

I have created this react project with the help of vite build tool.
